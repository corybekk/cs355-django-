-admin.py  "used to make columns on the webpage"
-views.py  information that you and the user can interact with but it does not save it to the database
-models.py  where you define each entity of the database
-template.html uses the functions in views.py to create the actual html interface on the webpage
The code inside the template is html code that organizes the data on the page

 mysql -p -u cbekker < department.sql "import the department table data into the django page"

python manage.py sql code1

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80007


log into mysql    mysql -p -u cbekker

use databasename
show tables
describe table

1)in Settings.py  I need to change to the name from cbekker_django to a different name. The name is the
name of the database you are using. You can check what databases you have in mysql by logging in
mysql -u cbekker -p

2)kooshes said to make a new database for project 2. Analysis: when we sync a database to the django
project it creates the tables? correct? well if we use the old database and we sync it, then it
will mess up the primary keys and references because django does it differently? or names it differemtly?

3)forms- to create a form you need to create a template "html file" that gives
the visual  layout of the form. You have to make a view. you have to also
have to change the urls.
